# Algorithm design & analysis (COM-019 @ UPGDL)

Repository with sample code for the COM-019 class.

## 1. Computational thinking

This chapter deals with basic syntax, and the way we map our solutions into simple code.

## 2. C++ basics

This chapter talks about the structure of a program, variables, constants, data types and how to comment.

## 3. Control structures I - Selection

This chapter talks about the basic comparison operators and gives an explanation of how these work (truth tables), we also discuss the selection structures available in C++.

- if / if-else / if-else if-else
- switch

## 4. Control structures II - Loops

This chapter talks about the looping structures available in C++ and how to manipulate them to change the default behavior

- for
- while
- do-while

## 5. Functions I

This chapter discusses the functions in C++, its declaration, what is a parameter, return types, signature of a function and prototypes, as well as the concept of scope for variables.

## 6. Arrays

This chapter deals with the multidimensionality of arrays.

## 7. Strings & IO Files

This chapter deals with the special _string_ type and some of its functionality; how do we improve the output with proper handling of the display in console as well as input and output files.
